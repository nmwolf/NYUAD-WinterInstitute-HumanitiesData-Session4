    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization of data can be a powerful way to understand subjects of study from a different point of view, eliciting patterns or areas of analysis that might not otherwise be detected through reading a source only.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a need for humanists to diversify the approaches that they use to map humanities data. The tendency to select points as a representation of a source is strong. But there are other ways to represent spatial relationships. We'll work with one in particular, line segments, which can be a powerful way to model itineraries, journeys, and other forms of movement across landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in this session we'll consider a new \"container\" for how we can hold data, JSON.\n",

    "1. We will be deriving our data from a tourist's guide to a city from the early 20th century. What would be the expected biases, rhetorical techniques, mediated views, or assumptions that we would expect in a source like this? What critical stance would we need to adopt to profitably interpret this source?\n",

    "2. For this session, we will concentrate on two sections of the guide entitled \"A Tour of the City\" and \"A Ramble at Night.\" Let's talk a little bit about what early 20th conceptions of cities during the day and night might entail."

    "### 2. Introduction to JSON and to GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a variety of options open to us as to how we can structure representations of our data so that the data can be written to a computer file for storage. For the most part, we seek forms that are easy to read for humans who view the characters that together make up a reprsentation of that data, and yet are highly structured (e.g. predictable) enough that a computer can interpret their contents consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when working with tabular data, we work in terms of character-separated rows of records. CSVs, or comma-separated systems, are very common. \n",
    "\n",
    "But another useful system is called javascript objection notation, JSON, and it involves moving our tabular records/observations to a series (array) of repeated variable-value pairs. Think of this as repeatedly linking a row value to its column (variable) label. A drawback to this is that the resulting object contains a lot more characters (our column/variable names are repeated a lot), but among the advantages are that the order that we list out our \"cell values\" no longer matters -- every value is linked to its variable as well as to its accompanying values. It is also more extensible. Since the contents of any JSON value can itself be rendered in JSON, we can have a highly complex, multidimensional data structure described using a relatively minimal container.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a table like this (examples from NYU's [Arabic Collections Online](http://dlib.nyu.edu/aco/)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Year</th><th>Title</th><th>Holding Library</th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>1962</td><td>al- Murshid ilá mawāṭin al-āthār wa-al-ḥaḍārah</td><td>NYU</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>1946</td><td>ʻAwdaẗ al-rūḥ</td><td>NYU</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our JSON equivalent would look like this:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\"Year\":\"1962\",\n",
    "   \"Title\":\"al- Murshid ilá mawāṭin al-āthār wa-al-ḥaḍārah\",\n",
    "   \"Holding Library\":\"NYU\"\n",

    "   \"Holding Library\":\"NYU\"\n",
    "   }\n",
    "]\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "Now suppose we have more than one author for each work in our table. Using tables, this gets a little awkward to convey and still maintain a \"tidy data\" approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Year</th><th>Title</th><th>Authors</th><th>Holding Library</th></tr>\n",

    "    <tr><td>1946</td><td>ʻAwdaẗ al-rūḥ</td><td>Ḥakīm, Tawfīq.</td><td>NYU</td></tr>\n",

    "**GeoJSON and Spatial Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have encountered spatial data in a variety of other formats such as ESRI's shapefiles or the KML. Another way to store and compactly convey spatial data is via JSON that follows a [GeoJSON formatting standard](http://wiki.geojson.org/Main_Page). Consider approach a way of storing all of the points needed to make a point, line or polygon on a map, and any associated data that goes along with the spatial feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "Those coordinates are our decimal degrees once again, though in a specific order: x, y, **or longitude, latitude (take note!)**\n",
    "\n",

Compiling a list of locations that can serve as endpoints for our linestrings, our aim is to build a line-segment based representation of the direction of travel recommended by the chapter.
